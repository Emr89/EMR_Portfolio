<p>Hello there! &hellip;. (GENERAL KENOBI !!)</p>
<p>My name is Eric Matthew Rupinski and I&rsquo;m a creatively passionate statistics graduate with a focus in data analytics and strategy. I graduated from Rutgers with a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Statistics and a Minor in Psychology. My love for Statistics started when I first studied Quantative Methods of Psychology and I realized that I loved the methodical approach to tackling questions that many consider to be too grandoise to analyze. Though I still love the idea of understanding the human mind and behaviors that came with studying Psychology, I switched my path to focus on Statistics with only a Minor in Psychology and I never looked back.</p>
<p>Even before my love for Statistics emerged, I always had a deep passion for Team Sports and teamwork. I grew up loving Soccer and Football, and recently developed a love for Hockey and Baseball. My love was never divided by specific cities or players, but rather to game itself, and with that came a love for understanding the relationships between performance factors to adapt into strategy and working solutions. Ever since I switched to Statistics, I had been tinkering with my own Football analysis projects to answer questions that I had about the dynamic of the sport, such as trying to answer which Quarterback was better in that famous Kansas City Chiefs Versus Los Angeles Rams in 2018, or what other performance factors could help predict the outcomes of each game. Eventually, my passion earned me a mentorship with the NFL, where I created a project to help predict what positional factors and performance factors determined the success of kick return yardage and how a kickoff team could strategize against that, using tracking data at the instantaneous moment the kick was recieved. My conclusions were that you could predict the outcome the kick return yardage with an Rsquared value of 0.5, or a 50% accuracy, and that the Kickoff teams best strategy was to have the 2 fastest players on the team be the gunners, and the rest of the kickoff team had to focus on cohesive movement as a group to prevent gap breakdowns.</p>
<p>My personality itself goes together perfectly with my passions. I am wired to solve problems rather than create them or complain about them, and I do so by utilizing my creativity to find the best possible solutions for all parties involved. I have a deep love for the people around me and for connecting with everyone I can to understand their perspective and their problems, and I&rsquo;m motivated to do the best I can to solve those problems. My passion, compassion, resilience, and integrity are what I am defined by, and though I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of ups and downs, and my determination to hold strong and do whats right, and whats best for others, always remains. I love to learn new methods to solve problems, as well as other&rsquo;s perspectives and experiences, to help me have the best arsenal when solving problems that I can. I&rsquo;m dedicated to self-growth and self-reflection, and use meditation as a path of self-betterment. My motivation will always be to help others and use my skils and determination to better the world around me.</p>
<p>My personal interests include meditation, sports, creative writing, Star Wars, video games with amazingly detailed stories and characters such as the Mass Effect Series or Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3, pampering my cat; Azula, connecting with and helping others, the beach, traveling, listening to music, self-improvement reflections, learning about the Roman Empire, distance running, and constant learning about my passions and new perspectives to expand my mind.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and I hope you appreciate my work.</p>
<p>&ndash; Eric Matthew Rupinski</p>
